This repository contains code for the useR2017 tutorial "Introduction
to optimal changepoint detection algorithms" by Toby Dylan Hocking and
Rebecca Killick.

** TODOs

For a more advanced tutorial, check out coarseDataTools::EMforCFR,
adapEnetClass, icenReg, and non-linear models.

Try `cv.glmnet(family="poisson")` for predicting the number of
changepoints.

[[file:depmixS4.models.R]] tries to fit an HMM to the neuroblastoma data
set, but I ran into [[file:depmixS4.bugs.R]] -- I emailed the author
<i.visser@uva.nl> on May 31 but I haven't heard anything yet.

[[file:montreal-biohackathon-2017.org]] describes a changepoint detection
challenge for a 24 hour Biohackathon.

** 13 Feb 2017
[[file:figure-regression-interactive-some.R]] creates [[http://bl.ocks.org/tdhock/raw/eee5fd673c258ae554702d9c7c60f69b/][5 plot interactive data viz]].
** 9 Feb 2017

[[file:figure-regression-interactive-some.R]] for interactive figure with
a few profiles that we can zoom in
to. http://bl.ocks.org/tdhock/raw/9fc37a7aaf291cef364aab3fb41dd898/

[[file:figure-regression-interactive.R]] for comparing BIC and learned
model on entire neuroblastoma data set.

penaltyLearning package for exactModelSelection and targetInterval.

** 25 Nov 2016

Begin [[file:breakpoint.learning.cv.R]] which will read
[[file:breakpoint.learning.RData]] and estimate breakpoint predicted test
error via 6-fold cross-validation (including BIC, mBIC, supervised
penalty learning via iregnet).
